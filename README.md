## Motivation for Development
This app provides a solution to individuals looking for a snapshot of home value information in one place.
People are relocating, or life events require you to move to another location. With this app, you can research a respective neighborhood for home prices, real estate & tax rates, and while youâ€™re at it you can also link to resources for home owners. 


## Design Process
 - Simple interface with mobile responsiveness. 
 - Implementing Materialize for CSS design elements.
